# WebApp - Vite Build Setup

This project uses Vite for frontend asset bundling and minification.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Build Process

### Development
Run Vite in development mode with hot module replacement:
```
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
Build minified assets for production:
```
npm run build
```

This will:
- Bundle `Assets/main.js` (which imports `site.js` and `site.css`)
- Minify JavaScript and CSS
- Output to `wwwroot/dist/js/main.min.js` and `wwwroot/dist/css/site.min.css`

## File Structure

- `Assets/` - Source files for frontend assets
  - `main.js` - Entry point that imports all assets
  - `site.js` - Custom JavaScript
  - `site.css` - Custom CSS
- `wwwroot/` - Static web assets served by ASP.NET Core
  - `dist/` - Built and minified assets (generated by Vite)
  - `lib/` - Third-party libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery, etc.)

## Integration with ASP.NET Core

The build process is designed to work seamlessly with ASP.NET Core:
1. Run `npm run build` before building the .NET project
2. The output in `wwwroot/dist/` is served as static files
