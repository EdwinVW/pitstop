# Pitstop.Infrastructure.Messaging library
This library contains helper-classes for working with messaging within the Pitstop sample solution. It contains the following items:

- The base-classes for Commands and Events.
- Interfaces that abstract functionality to publish and consume messages using a message-broker. 
- Implementations for the interfaces that use RabbitMQ as message-broker.
- A helper class (_MessageSerializer_) for serializing and deserializing commands and events to and from JSON.
